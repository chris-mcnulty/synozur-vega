## Strategies

### 1. Operate as AI first frontier firm

Our strategy as an AI-native firm is to embed artificial intelligence into the very fabric of our business model—treating AI not as a bolt-on tool but as a core driver of value creation, agility, and innovation. From governance and data architecture to customer engagement and product design, every process is built to leverage AI for smarter decisions, faster execution, and scalable impact. We prioritize responsible AI practices, robust cloud-native infrastructure, and continuous learning to ensure ethical, secure, and adaptive solutions. By aligning people, process, and technology around AI from day one, we position ourselves to deliver transformative outcomes for clients and maintain a competitive edge in an economy defined by algorithmic speed and insight scarcity

**Status:** not-started

### 2. Customer centric, storytelling and outcome driven messaging

Positioning & Messaging: Emphasize customer-centric storytelling and outcome-driven messaging in all marketing. In our narratives, the customer is the hero – we showcase client transformation journeys, not just our products. We highlight the impact on the client’s business (e.g. cultural change, growth, efficiency) rather than over-focusing on any specific technology. Our marketing content will reinforce Synozur’s values and mission, making clear that we bring extensive experience and a human-centered approach to every engagement. In short, we sell outcomes and trust: leveraging our team’s Fortune 500 background and ethical, empathetic approach as key differentiators

**Status:** in-progress

### 3. Mid Market Focus

Target Market Focus: Concentrate on the mid-market segment where we can win. Our sweet spot is organizations with >$50 M annual revenue that need transformation guidance. Geographically, we’re primarily focused on the U.S. market for now, with an eye toward global expansion as we grow. We prioritize industries where our team has deep experience – e.g. manufacturing, insurance, pharma, ISVs, and finance – to bring credible expertise to clients.

**Status:** on-track

### 4. Focus on strategic advisory services

Key Offerings & Services: Focus on strategic advisory services (not commoditized implementation). We position Synozur firmly as “the transformation company” – providing high-impact strategic guidance (leadership, culture, market strategy) rather than low-level IT implementation. Our offerings in 2025 center on Strategic Transformation (e.g. defining vision and roadmaps, fractional CxO leadership, Company OS implementation) and Digital/Workforce Transformation (employee experience, AI readiness, etc.), as outlined in our Messaging & Positioning Framework. This focus ensures we align with our purpose of helping clients “find their North Star” and achieve lasting change.

### 5. Partnership Strategy

Partnerships Strategy: Leverage alliances to extend our capabilities. We are pursuing partnerships with global systems integrators (GSIs) and mid-market firms to tackle transformation projects that bigger consultancies overlook. As a certified Microsoft Solutions Partner, we’ll deepen our Microsoft alliance now, while planning to expand into other ecosystems (e.g. Google) in the future. (In short, “Microsoft now, Google later.”) We also decided to avoid reselling software – we won’t act as a vendor or reseller – to remain objective advisors focused purely on transformation outcomes.
