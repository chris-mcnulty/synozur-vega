You are a senior conversion-focused product marketing + frontend engineer. Update the Vega marketing site pages to improve readability and increase free-trial signups.

TARGET PAGES
1) https://vega.synozur.com (primary marketing site / landing page)

PRIMARY GOAL
Increase trial signups (primary CTA) while keeping enterprise credibility (security, SOC2, Entra SSO, RBAC).

AUDIENCE
CEOs/COOs, Heads of Strategy/Transformation, and consultants who need a “Company Operating System” to turn strategy into execution.

BRAND / VOICE
Clear, confident, empathetic, not hypey. Avoid jargon. Short sentences. Scannable sections. Use outcome language. Use “North Star” sparingly. Keep tone professional.

PAGE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Above the fold must answer “What is it?” + “Who is it for?” + “Why now?” in < 7 seconds
- One dominant primary CTA repeated throughout
- Break long paragraphs into short blocks and bullet lists
- Use cards for features (outcome-first) rather than long feature walls
- Move security/compliance down the page but make it strong and scannable
- Add a “What you’ll do in your first 15 minutes” trial onboarding section near the top
- Add “Who it’s for / not for” to reduce uncertainty
- Add sticky header CTA
- Ensure excellent mobile readability (spacing, font sizes, line length)

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS (FRONTEND)
- Use a clean, modern SaaS landing layout with these sections in this order:
  1) Sticky Header (logo left, nav anchors, primary CTA button right)
  2) Hero (headline, subhead, primary CTA, secondary CTA)
  3) Trust strip (SOC2 / Entra SSO / RBAC / Audit trails as short badges)
  4) “First 15 minutes” section (numbered steps + screenshot placeholder)
  5) Outcomes section (3 cards: Align, Execute, Learn/Adjust)
  6) “How Vega is different” section (3 cards)
  7) “Who it’s for / not for” two-column block
  8) Modules overview (Foundations, Strategy, Planning/OKRs, Focus Rhythm, AI Assistant) as compact cards w/ “Explore in trial” links
  9) Security & Compliance (strong but below conversion sections)
  10) Final CTA band (restate value + CTA)
  11) Footer (links, privacy, terms)

CTA BEHAVIOR
- Primary CTA button text (consistent): “Start a free trial”
- Under-CTA microcopy: “No credit card. Be set up in minutes.”
- Secondary CTA: “Watch 2-minute walkthrough” (opens modal or goes to /demo)
- Repeat primary CTA after sections 4, 7, and 10

WHO IT’S FOR / NOT FOR
For:
- “CEOs & COOs scaling beyond ad-hoc leadership”

MODULES OVERVIEW (COMPACT CARDS)
Each card includes a 1-sentence outcome description and an “Explore in trial →” link.
- Foundations: mission/vision/values/goals
- Strategy: strategic priorities aligned to annual goals
- Planning (OKRs): objectives, weighted key results, check-ins

VISUALS
- Add 1 hero image or product screenshot placeholder (use a local image asset path like /assets/vega-hero.png). If no assets, create a simple placeholder block with “Product UI screenshot”.
- Add small iconography for cards (optional).

TECHNICAL / SEO
- Ensure semantic headings (one H1, structured H2/H3)
- Add meta title + description focused on trial
- Add canonical URL to synozur domain
- Performance: optimize images, avoid heavy JS
- Accessibility: button labels, contrast, keyboard nav

DO NOT
- Do not add long paragraphs.
- Do not bury the trial CTA below multiple scrolls.
- Do not use hypey words like “revolutionary” or “game-changing”.
- Do not remove enterprise security credibility; just move it lower and make it scannable.

Ensure site uses responsive design and that home page and login page are consistent in look and feel. Feel free to use attached brand imagery but do not let pictures dominate other than the existing screenshot on the home page.
