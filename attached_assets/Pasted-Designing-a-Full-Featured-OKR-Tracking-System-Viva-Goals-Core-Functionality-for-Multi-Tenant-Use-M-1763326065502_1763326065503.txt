Designing a Full-Featured OKR Tracking System (Viva Goals Core Functionality) for Multi-Tenant Use
Microsoft Viva Goals is a comprehensive Objectives and Key Results (OKR) management tool that helps organizations set, track, and align goals across teams and individuals9. To replicate its core functionality on Replit, the system must support multi-level goal alignment, progress tracking with visual indicators, regular check-ins, dashboard reporting, and integrations with external tools, all in a multi-user, multi-tenant environment. Below we outline these features and how to implement them, prioritizing the essential elements first.


1. Multi-Level Goal Alignment Across Organization, Teams, and Individuals
A core strength of Viva Goals is ensuring all goals are aligned up, down, and across the organization8. To replicate this:
Hierarchical OKR Structure: Organize objectives in a three-tier hierarchy – typically Organization-level OKRs, Team-level OKRs, and Individual OKRs5. Each objective can have child objectives or key results beneath it, forming a tree. This structure lets everyone see how their work contributes to higher-level goals8. For example, a company-level objective can cascade down to team objectives, which further cascade to individual objectives8. 
Alignment Links (Parent/Child Goals): Each OKR entry should store a reference to a parent objective (if aligned) and list of child items (key results, sub-objectives, initiatives). In practice, aligning an OKR means linking it to a higher-level goal it supports8. This provides visibility and transparency – individuals clearly see how their goal supports broader objectives8. In the UI, this is often visualized as a nested tree or a chart diagram of objectives5. 
Multiple Alignment & Shared OKRs: Support scenarios where goals span multiple teams or owners. Viva Goals allows shared OKRs – an objective that is owned by multiple teams or individuals simultaneously7. For instance, a key initiative might involve both the Marketing and Sales teams, and thus the same goal can be shared rather than duplicated, ensuring cross-functional alignment7. Implementation-wise, this means an OKR record can have multiple owners or team tags and appear in each relevant team’s view, but updated in one place7. 
Weighted Contributions: When rolling up progress from child key results to a parent objective, allow weighting. Viva Goals’ contribution feature lets objective owners assign specific weight percentages to each child key result or sub-objective, which all sum to 100%7. By default, contributions are evenly distributed, but owners can mark certain children with fixed weights (e.g., one key result might count for 50% of the parent objective’s progress)7. This ensures the parent’s progress reflects the relative importance of each contributor. Implement this by storing a contribution factor for each child link and using it in progress calculations (see Progress Tracking below). 
Key Implementation Considerations: Maintain a robust data model for Organizations, Teams, Users, and OKRs (Objectives, Key Results, Initiatives). Each objective record should include fields like title, description, owner(s), team/org context, time period, parent objective (for alignment), type (org/team/individual), and alignment permissions. The system should enforce that organizational objectives can have team objectives aligned, which in turn have individual objectives aligned beneath them5. Also provide controls to edit alignment (re-link a goal’s parent) and to ensure alignment integrity (e.g., prevent circular links, handle removal of a parent by re-homing children). By structuring goals hierarchically with flexible alignment, the platform will mirror Viva Goals’ ability to “connect teams to your organization’s strategic priorities”9.
2. OKR Entities: Objectives, Key Results, and Initiatives
In an OKR system, it’s essential to distinguish between Objectives, Key Results (KRs), and Initiatives (or projects), as Viva Goals does:
Objectives: High-level qualitative goals “what you want to accomplish”2. They are typically aspirational and time-bound (e.g., achieve X by end of quarter). In the system, an Objective is an entity that can have multiple KRs or sub-objectives. Key fields: Title, Description, Owner(s), Team/Org (scope), Time Period (e.g., Q4 2025)2, and an optional parent objective (“Aligned to”)2. Objectives also have a progress measurement setting: either progress is rolled up from its KRs or updated manually2. Similarly, status can be auto-derived or manually set2. (If rolled up, the weighted contributions of KRs apply7.) 
Key Results: Quantitative, measurable outcomes that indicate achievement of an objective (the “measurable outcomes” for the objective)2. KRs are usually expressed as a metric with a target value (increase/decrease a number to a target). For each KR, store fields like Metric Name, Current Value, Target Value, and optionally Initial Value (baseline)2. Viva Goals allows defining the KR type (e.g., increase from X to Y, attain at least Y, etc.) and supports phased targets (intermediate milestones)2. Implementation: present KRs under their parent Objective in the hierarchy. Progress for a KR is typically a straightforward percentage of current value vs. target (or manually input percentage) and usually updates the parent objective’s progress if the objective is roll-up based2. A KR can itself have initiatives (tasks) attached for execution tracking2, but typically not child KRs (they are leaf nodes measuring an objective). 
Initiatives: These are projects, tasks, or activities that drive progress toward KRs and objectives2. In Viva Goals, initiatives are essentially action plans (referred to as “Projects” in older terminology)2. They may not have a numeric target like KRs, but can have their own checklist of tasks and a completion status. Our system can implement initiatives as an optional child item under an Objective or KR, with fields: Title, Owner (who leads the initiative), Due Date, and optional completion metric (percent done or simple done/not done). Viva Goals distinguishes local initiatives vs. integrated ones2. Local initiatives are tracked within the OKR tool (we can allow adding a list of tasks with owners and deadlines2). Integrated initiatives link to external project management tools (like Asana, Trello, Planner), so updates on tasks there reflect in the OKR system2. For now, simply include ability to mark progress or completion of initiatives, and possibly integrate via APIs with external task tools (elaborated under Integrations below). 
By defining these entities, the system will capture both the goals and the means to achieve them, just as Viva Goals does by letting users “create and document your objectives and key results… [and] initiatives help you track work toward your objectives”2. The relationships are:
Objectives can contain KRs and Initiatives (and even child Objectives in multi-level alignment). 
Key Results belong to an Objective. 
Initiatives belong to an Objective or a Key Result (configurable)2. This structure ensures clarity on goals (“what and why”) and actions (“how”), mirroring Viva Goals functionality. 
3. Progress Tracking with Visual Indicators
Tracking progress is at the heart of OKR software. Viva Goals provides a visual progress bar for each OKR along with status indicators6. To replicate this:
Progress Metrics & Calculation: Every objective and KR has an associated progress value (0–100%) representing completion. For KRs, progress is computed from the metric (e.g., current vs target). For objectives, progress can be computed in two ways:
Roll-up (Aggregated): If the objective’s progress is set to roll up from its child KRs, calculate objective progress as a weighted average of its KRs’ progress7. Use the contribution weights if provided; otherwise equal weighting (e.g., if an objective has 4 KRs, each default 25% contribution to the objective)7. 
Manual Update: Alternatively, allow manual setting of objective progress (useful if an objective is qualitative or doesn’t have clear KRs)2. The system should support both modes, just like Viva Goals allows choosing “Update from key results” vs. “Update manually” for progress tracking2. 
Progress Bar Visualization: Display a horizontal progress bar for each goal. Viva Goals shows actual progress as a filled portion and expected progress as a vertical marker on the bar6. To implement:
Actual Progress – the current completion % (from check-ins or integration updates) shown as the fill with a numeric percentage label6. 
Expected Progress – a calculated value based on time elapsed in the goal’s timeframe6. Using the goal’s start and end dates, the system can compute where progress should be if it were perfectly linear over time (e.g., on day 50 of a 100-day period, expected ~50% complete)6. This can be shown as a thin line or secondary marker on the bar to give context. For example, on the first day expected = 0%, on the last day = 100%, and it linearly increases in between6. The comparison of actual vs expected helps identify if a goal is on track. 
Status Indicators (On Track / Behind / At Risk / Completed): Based on progress, assign a status with color coding:
On Track (green) – when actual progress is close or ahead of expected. By default Viva Goals considers on track if actual ≥ expected (difference <= 0%)6. 
Behind (yellow) – slightly behind schedule. In Viva, if actual lags expected by more than 0% up to 25% points6. 
At Risk (red) – significantly behind schedule. In Viva, if actual lags expected by >25% points6. 
Completed – when progress hits 100% (goal achieved) or if marked closed. Also consider Postponed or Cancelled statuses if a goal is deferred6. 
These thresholds should be configurable by admins (Viva Goals even allows customizing these ranges instead of fixed 25% cutoffs6). The system should automatically compute a derived status based on progress numbers, but also allow manual override. Viva Goals permits users to manually mark status during check-in (e.g., explicitly set “On Track” or “At Risk”), which then locks the status to that selection6. If we implement manual status, ensure any automated update doesn’t override user choice unless prompted6.
Historical Progress Graph: For richer tracking, maintain a history of progress over time (from each check-in). Viva Goals provides a progress graph on the objective’s detail view to show the trend of progress vs time6. We could implement a simple line chart plotting progress % on the y-axis and dates on the x-axis for each goal, which can be displayed in a dashboard or detail panel. 
With these, each user can quickly gauge how a goal is doing. For example, an objective’s progress bar might show 56% complete vs 82% expected, clearly indicating it's “Behind” schedule6. Such visual cues drive transparency and prompt timely action. The combination of numeric progress and color status satisfies the need for a quick health check on goals.
4. Regular Check-Ins and Updates
Check-ins are the mechanism for updating progress and keeping OKRs up-to-date. Viva Goals emphasizes “regular check-ins… to monitor your progress” and recommends a weekly cadence3. To replicate:
Check-In Cadence: Encourage users to update their OKRs regularly (e.g., every week). This can be implemented through reminders and an easy check-in interface. Viva Goals suggests weekly check-ins to maintain a clear picture of progress3. The system might send automated notifications (email or in-app) to owners of goals that haven’t been updated recently. 
Manual Check-In Process: Provide a UI to select a goal and enter a new value or percentage. When a user performs a check-in:
Update Progress: The user inputs the latest metric value or completion % for the KR or objective. For example, if the KR was “increase customers from 25 to 100” and currently 30 customers have been reached, the user would input 30 (or 20% progress)3. The system then recalculates the progress percentage and updates the progress bar3. 
Add a Comment/Note: Allow an optional text note with the check-in. This note can capture context, achievements, or challenges since the last update (e.g., “Great progress this week with five new articles.”)3. Storing and displaying the last check-in note is useful for others reviewing the goal5. 
Update Status (if manual): If the user wants to adjust the status flag (On Track/Behind/etc.) manually, they can do so during check-in (especially if they disagree with the auto-derived status)6. 
Record Timestamp and User: Log who made the update and when. Viva Goals shows “how and when the last update was made” and “who made the update,” improving accountability6. 
Integrated (Automatic) Check-Ins: Not all updates need to be manual. The system should allow connecting a goal’s progress to an external data source so that updates flow in automatically3. For example, link a sales target KR to a live sales dashboard or a task-count to Azure DevOps. Viva Goals supports integrations that update OKRs hourly from external systems3. Implementation could involve writing integration scripts or using webhooks/API to pull data (see Integrations section). In use, an integrated check-in means the user doesn’t have to enter numbers — the system fetches the latest value. Still, users might perform occasional manual syncs or overrides. Provide a “Sync Now” option to fetch latest data on-demand (Viva Goals has a Sync button for immediate refresh of integrated data)3. 
Audit Trail and History: Each check-in (manual or automated) should append to the goal’s history. Users and managers might review the sequence of updates. The Activity log or History tab for an OKR can list each check-in date, value, note, and user. This historical insight is useful during end-of-quarter reflection or scoring. 
Check-In Ownership: If multiple people own a goal, designate one as the check-in owner to avoid confusion. Viva Goals lets you assign a specific person responsible for updating progress when there are many owners2. Our system should similarly allow an “update responsible” field for each goal if needed. 
Why this matters: Regular check-ins create a rhythm of accountability and course-correction. The system we build should mirror Viva Goals’ approach where “consistent check-ins provide a clear picture of your progress and help ensure you remain on track”3. By making check-ins easy (quick manual updates or, even better, automated via integrations) and visible (notes and timestamps on dashboards6), users stay engaged with their OKRs and management has current data on goal attainment.
5. Dashboards and OKR Visualization
To manage OKRs at scale, the platform should offer dashboards and views for different contexts (organization-wide overview, team progress, personal goals). Viva Goals provides multiple views and a customizable review dashboard for tracking and presenting OKRs54. Key implementations:
List and Hierarchy View: The default view should list OKRs in a hierarchical tree (expandable outline) by alignment5. Users can expand an objective to see its KRs, sub-objectives, and initiatives indented beneath5. This allows quick navigation and in-place status viewing. Include columns like Owner, Progress % bar, Status, Time Period, etc.5 for each OKR in the list. Viva Goals also allows filtering or grouping this list (by time period, team, owner, status) to slice the data5, which we can incorporate through filter controls. 
Quick View / Detail Panel: When a user selects a specific OKR, show a detailed panel or page with comprehensive information5. Viva Goals’ quick view includes tabs or sections for:
Overview: Key fields and the progress summary (progress bar with actual vs expected, current status, last updated timestamp)5. Also show the alignment path (e.g., “Aligned to: [Parent Objective]”) with option to navigate to parent or children5. Additionally, display the last check-in note here for context5. 
Key Results: List of KRs under that objective with their individual progress and owners5. 
Initiatives: List of initiatives (projects/tasks) under the objective, with their status2. 
Child Objectives: (if any) further nested objectives aligned below (this might overlap with KRs if using them exclusively, but in case of multiple alignment or special cases)5. 
Activity: A log of check-ins or changes over time. 
This detailed view helps in meetings or one-on-ones where you review a single OKR in depth.
Customizable Dashboards: Provide a feature to create custom dashboards comprised of various OKR data widgets, just as Viva Goals offers Review Dashboards for different audience levels4. Each dashboard can serve a specific purpose:
Organization-level Dashboard: For leadership to review progress of company-wide objectives (e.g., in QBR meetings)4. 
Team Dashboard: For team leads to track their team’s OKRs in stand-ups or bi-weekly reviews4. 
Individual Dashboard: For employees to see their personal goals and contributions (useful in one-on-one meetings)4. 
Allow users to create multiple dashboards and select which objectives or KRs to include. Implementation can allow adding panels to a dashboard, where each panel contains a specific set of data or widget4. Viva Goals supports widgets like:
OKR List (a filtered list of certain objectives/KRs), 
KPI List (key performance indicators), 
OKR Detail (a highlight of one goal’s status), 
Initiative List, 
Text Block (for commentary), 
Custom Embed (possibly charts or external content)4. 
We should at least allow showing a list of selected OKRs and perhaps basic text or metric widgets. Also, include features to share these dashboards via link and a presentation mode (full-screen view for meetings)4.
Aggregated Reporting: The system can optionally compute overall statistics, such as the percentage of goals on track vs behind, or average progress per team. These could be shown as aggregate metrics on an admin’s dashboard or an executive summary. For example, a metric card could show “75% of Q4 Objectives On Track” (this could be manually derived from statuses). 
The goal of these views is to surface the most relevant information at the right level of detail. By giving each user a tailored view (and the ability to drill down), our Replit-based OKR tracker can “visually organize collections of data” for review and help users and stakeholders stay informed and engaged with goal progress4.
6. Integration with External Tools and Platforms
To truly replicate Viva Goals, we must support integrations that connect goal tracking with other systems. Integrations serve two primary purposes in Viva Goals: automating data updates for progress and embedding OKR activities in users’ daily workflow3.
Data Integrations for Progress Updates: Viva Goals can pull data automatically from a variety of sources (work tracking, databases, spreadsheets, etc.) to update key results3. Our system should provide an API or connectors to do the same. For example:
Connect to project management and issue tracking tools like Azure DevOps, Jira, GitHub – to update KRs such as “# of issues closed” or “deployment count” as these tools change. 
Connect to spreadsheet or database sources like Excel Online, Google Sheets, SQL databases – useful for financial or KPI metrics tracked in sheets1. 
Connect to CRM or analytics tools like Salesforce or HubSpot to update sales and marketing metrics1. 
Integration with BI tools (Power BI, Tableau) for high-level KPIs1. 
Viva Goals supports an extensive list of integrations, including Azure DevOps, Jira, Asana, Excel, Google Sheets, Microsoft Planner, GitHub, Slack, and many others1. We should prioritize a few key ones (for a prototype, maybe a simple CSV/Excel import, a Jira API connector, etc.) but design in a way that additional connectors can be added. Data integrations typically run on a schedule (Viva Goals checks hourly for updates)31, with an option to sync on demand3. Implementation tip: define an integration interface where each integration has a type, connection credentials, and mapping of external data to a specific OKR’s metric. A background job can fetch data and update the OKR value.
Collaboration Integrations (Teams/Slack): Since users spend time in communication tools, integrate with platforms like Microsoft Teams or Slack for easier check-ins and notifications. Viva Goals allows users to perform a check-in directly from Teams/Slack without opening the app3, and sends reminder notifications through these channels3. For our system, we can create:
Chatbot or Slash Command: e.g., a Slack bot command like /okr update 30% "note" to log a check-in, or a Teams message extension to update progress. 
Notifications: push alerts to Slack/Teams when a check-in is due or a goal goes “At Risk”. 
Single Sign-On and User Provisioning: In a multi-tenant enterprise scenario, integration with identity providers (Azure AD, etc.) might be needed for user management. While an advanced topic, acknowledging SSO can be useful (although architecture-related, not core feature, but it’s part of integration with corporate systems). 
Benefits of Integration: Emphasize that these integrations make the OKR tracking “as simple, effective, and seamless as possible”3. By automatically pulling from the “single source of truth” where work is already happening, we eliminate redundant data entry3. For example, if a dev team tracks bugs closed in Azure DevOps, linking that to the OKR means progress updates without extra effort3. This fosters user adoption since “check-ins occur automatically, without disrupting your workflow”3. 
Integration Setup for Admins: Provide an admin interface to configure integrations (enter API keys, choose project boards, etc.), similar to Viva Goals’ integration settings where an admin enables and connects an integration at the org level1. Also allow making a connection either public (org-wide) or private to the user for flexibility1 (e.g., a private integration could be a personal Excel file, versus a public one like a central Salesforce connection). 
By incorporating integrations, our OKR system doesn’t live in isolation—it ties into the user’s ecosystem of tools. Automation reduces manual work, and letting users interact via chat platforms increases engagement. This is crucial for a full-featured solution, aligning with Viva Goals’ support for many third-party tools (from Azure DevOps to Salesforce and Slack)1.
7. Multi-User, Multi-Tenant Support and Security
Since the target is multiple users across multiple tenants, the system must enforce tenant isolation, role-based access, and collaboration controls:
Multiple Tenants (Organizations): The system should isolate data by organization. In Viva Goals, each company has its own Viva Goals organization, often corresponding to an Microsoft 365 tenant, with its own OKRs, teams, and users. In our design, a tenant (org) ID will scope all data. Users belong to one or more organizations. Ensure that a user from Tenant A cannot access any data from Tenant B. Each org can have its own administrators and settings1. 
User Roles and Permissions: Implement role-based permissions akin to Viva Goals:
Org Admins: have full control over their organization’s settings, integrations, and data1. 
Team Admins/Leaders: manage team OKRs, invite team members. 
Members: can create and update OKRs they own or are shared on. 
Guests/Readers: maybe view-only roles if needed. 
Also, support assigning owners to OKRs and delegating updates (as mentioned, a delegate can check-in on behalf of an owner)2. Alignment permissions might control who can align a child objective to a parent2 – for example, requiring the parent’s owner’s approval; this is an advanced nuance we might simplify initially.
Collaboration and Visibility: Within a tenant, goals may be visible broadly (especially top-level org goals) to drive transparency. Team-level goals might be visible to all team members. Provide sharing settings: goals could be marked private (visible only to specific people) or public within the org. Viva Goals allows sharing OKRs with multiple owners and teams for collaboration7. We should ensure the data model allows multiple user IDs in the owner field and perhaps a list of viewers/editors for each goal. 
Time Periods and OKR Cycles: Manage goal cycles by time periods (quarters, yearly, etc.). The system should allow defining time periods and assigning each OKR to one (e.g., “2025 Q1” or “FY2025”)5. This helps filter and archive goals by cycle. Viva Goals uses time periods for navigation and summary views5. 
Scalability & Performance: Although more of an architectural concern, note that supporting many tenants and users means the code should scale – e.g., queries always filtered by tenant, efficient retrieval of hierarchical data (perhaps via caching or tree-structured queries). 
We mention these to ensure that in a multi-tenant setting, the core features still function per tenant without interference. Each organization will experience their own aligned goals, dashboards, etc., just as they would in Viva Goals.

To summarize, the Replit-based OKR tracking system should mirror the key features of Microsoft Viva Goals that make it effective for goal management:
Hierarchical Alignment: From company vision down to individual tasks, linking OKRs ensures everyone moves in the same direction8. 
Clear OKR Structure: Distinguish objectives (qualitative goals), key results (quantitative measures), and initiatives (actions/projects) to connect outcomes with outputs2. 
Real-Time Progress & Status: Visual progress bars, expected vs actual tracking, and color-coded health statuses for quick insight into which goals are on track or at risk6. 
Frequent Check-Ins: Regular updates (manual or automated) with context notes to keep data current and encourage accountability3. 
Dashboards & Reporting: Flexible views and shareable dashboards to review goals at all organizational levels, aiding communication in reviews and meetings4. 
Integrations: Seamless connections with external systems to auto-update progress and integrate OKR management into existing workflows (DevOps, CRM, spreadsheets, chat apps, etc.)31. 
Multi-Tenant, Multi-User Design: Robust support for multiple organizations, each with its own users, teams, and data isolation, plus role-based access control for proper governance17. 
By focusing on these features, the resulting system will closely replicate Viva Goals' core functionality and provide a full-featured OKR solution suitable for multiple users in multiple organizations.

Implementation Roadmap (Summary in Steps):
Step
Feature Area
Description & Key Actions
1.
Data Model & Setup
Define entities: Organizations, Teams, Users, Objectives, Key Results, Initiatives. Include fields for alignment (parent-child links), owners, metrics, status, etc. Set up role-based access and ensure tenant isolation for data21.
2.
Objective & KR Management
Implement CRUD for Objectives and KRs. Allow creating an objective with alignment to a parent and time period. Allow adding key results to objectives (with metric definitions)2. Ensure objectives can have multiple owners/teams (shared ownership)7.
3.
Goal Alignment Hierarchy
Build the logic to align objectives (setting a parent objective ID). Create UI to visualize hierarchy (expandable list or tree view) showing objectives with their KRs and children5. Support re-aligning goals and viewing alignment path.
4.
Progress Calculation
Develop progress tracking: if objective is roll-up, calculate aggregate progress from KRs (apply weightings if set)7. Otherwise, allow direct progress value. Implement expected progress computation based on dates6. Show progress bars with actual vs expected markers and derive status (On Track/Behind/At Risk) using predefined thresholds6.
5.
Check-In Functionality
Create a check-in interface. Users select a goal (objective or KR) to update, input new value or % and optional comment3. Update the goal’s progress and timestamp, and log the check-in note6. Build history log per goal. Implement reminders (e.g., weekly) for pending check-ins.
6.
Dashboards & Views
Develop default views: a main OKR list view (with filters by team, owner, status, time period)5, and a detailed view for each objective (overview, children, activity)5. Then add customizable dashboard capability: allow creating dashboards and adding widget panels such as lists of OKRs (e.g., all of a team’s OKRs) and KPI summaries4. Include sharing (link or permissions) and a presentation mode for these dashboards4.
7.
Integrations
Provide connectors for key integrations. For MVP, maybe implement a couple: e.g., fetch from a Google Sheet or an Azure DevOps work item query to update a KR. Design a plugin architecture so more integrations can be added. Also, integrate with a chat app (Slack/Teams) for updates: perhaps a basic bot that posts reminders or accepts progress updates3. Ensure admin UI for configuring integration credentials1.
8.
Testing & Refinement
Test with multiple users and organizations to ensure proper isolation and sharing. Adjust the progress status thresholds or defaults as needed. Refine the UI/UX for clarity (especially the alignment visuals and progress indicators). Collect feedback and iterate.
9.
Advanced Features
(Future enhancement) Add support for OKR scoring at period end, OKR templates, advanced analytics (e.g., OKR health trend), and mobile access. Also consider including the “Initiative tasks” breakdown feature to manage to-do lists within initiatives2. Refine integrations by adding more connectors from the Viva Goals list (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)1.
Each step builds on the previous to cover the full feature set. By the end, we’ll have an OKR tracking system that provides goal alignment, progress tracking, check-ins, dashboards, and integrations comparable to Viva Goals, all customizable for multiple organizations and teams.
