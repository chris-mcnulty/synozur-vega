🚀 Three New Features

1. Strategy Cascade Visualization (Strategy Map)

An interactive visual map showing how annual goals flow down to strategies, objectives, key results, and big rocks. This solves the problem of executives not being able to quickly see alignment gaps or understand how individual work connects to company strategy.

Key capabilities:

Sankey diagram or tree visualization with color-coded status
Visual detection of "orphan" items lacking proper linkages
Drill-down filtering by team, quarter, or company values
Exportable for presentations
2. OKR Health Scoring & Predictive Analytics

An AI-powered system that proactively monitors OKR health using multiple factors (progress trajectory, check-in frequency, historical performance, dependency health, time remaining) to predict outcomes before problems become critical.

Key capabilities:

Multi-factor health score (0-100) for every objective
Predictive classification: Likely to Achieve → Unlikely to Achieve
Smart alerts when items trend toward failure
AI-generated recovery recommendations
3. Cross-Team Dependencies & Collaboration Hub

A formal system for declaring, tracking, and communicating dependencies between teams. This breaks down organizational silos and prevents "surprise" blockers at quarter-end.

Key capabilities:

Dependency declarations (blocking, contributing, informational)
Network graph visualization of cross-team relationships
Request/accept workflow with discussion threads
Auto-integration with Focus Rhythm meeting agendas
✨ Three UX Enhancements

Key shortcuts:

2. Personalized Dashboard Widgets & Pinned Items

Make the Dashboard customizable with drag-and-drop widgets, allowing users to focus on what matters most to their role (executive, manager, or individual contributor).

Key capabilities:

Widget library (My OKRs, Team Health, At-Risk Items, AI Insights, etc.)
Drag-and-drop layout customization
Pin favorite objectives for quick access
Role-based default layouts
3. Progress Timeline & Activity Feed
