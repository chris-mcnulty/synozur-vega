You are a senior frontend engineer. Fix a layout bug on https://vega.synozur.com where the entire page content renders in a narrow left column and leaves a large empty white area on the right on wide screens.

GOAL
On desktop/wide screens (>= 1200px), the page should be centered and use the available width appropriately:
- No giant white gutter on the right
- Sections should be centered horizontally
- Backgrounds should span full width when intended (hero/feature bands)
- Content blocks should have a consistent max-width and be centered

WHAT TO DO (DIAGNOSE FIRST)
1) Inspect the DOM structure and identify the outermost layout wrappers:
   - body, #root / __next, main, page wrapper, section wrappers
2) Find the element that is constraining or offsetting layout (common culprits):
   - width: 50% / width: 640px / max-width without centering
   - display: grid with 2 columns where the right column is empty
   - flex container with an unused sibling or incorrect flex-basis
   - position: absolute/relative with left: 0 and no centering
3) Confirm the issue occurs only on wide screens by checking media queries.

FIX REQUIREMENTS (IMPLEMENT)
A) Establish a standard centered content container used across sections:
   - Create a reusable CSS utility/class, e.g. .container
   - Recommended:
     width: 100%;
     max-width: 1200px (or 1280px);
     margin-left: auto;
     margin-right: auto;
     padding-left/right: 24px (responsive)

B) Apply the container to all content sections so they center:
   - Hero content block
   - “First 15 minutes”
   - Outcomes cards
   - “How Vega is different”
   - “Is Vega right for you?”
   - Modules
   - Enterprise-ready
   - Screenshots
   - Footer columns

C) Ensure FULL-WIDTH BACKGROUNDS remain full-width:
   - For dark/gradient background sections, the section background should span 100vw,
     but inner content should be inside the centered container.

D) Remove/repair any layout that creates an empty right column:
   - If using CSS grid, ensure grid-template-columns is not leaving a blank column.
   - If you find something like grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; and the second column is empty,
     change to 1fr or remove the second column.
   - If using flex, ensure no sibling is reserving space (e.g., empty div with flex:1).

E) Add guardrails:
   - Ensure html, body { width: 100%; overflow-x: hidden; } ONLY if needed
   - Ensure no element uses fixed widths that break responsiveness
   - Make sure hero image/background is centered (background-position: center)

TAILWIND NOTE (IF APPLICABLE)
If the project uses Tailwind:
- Wrap major section contents in: <div className="mx-auto w-full max-w-6xl px-6">
- Ensure the outer section uses: w-full
- If any wrapper uses: max-w-* without mx-auto, add mx-auto
- If any layout uses: grid grid-cols-2 but second column is empty, change to grid-cols-1 on lg
  or remove the empty column.

CSS NOTE (IF NOT TAILWIND)
If plain CSS:
- Implement a .container class and apply it consistently.
- Audit for any left padding/margin causing offset (e.g., margin-left: 0 but no centering).

DELIVERABLES
1) Commit the layout fix so that on 1440px and 1920px wide screens the page is centered.
2) Provide a short note listing:
   - The root cause you found (e.g., “grid had 2 columns and right column was empty”)
   - Files changed (e.g., layout.css, HomePage.jsx)
   - The new container max-width used

DO NOT
- Do not change copy, colors, or typography unless necessary for layout centering.
- Do not remove full-width background styling; keep backgrounds full bleed with centered content.
