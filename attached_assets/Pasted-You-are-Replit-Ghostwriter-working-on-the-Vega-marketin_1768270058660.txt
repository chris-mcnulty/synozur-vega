You are Replit Ghostwriter working on the Vega marketing + auth UI.

Goal
Make it unmistakably clear that a visitor can start using Vega immediately via:
1) email/password account creation OR
2) Microsoft Entra SSO
…and that there is NO purchase and NO credit card required.

Constraints
- Do not change core styling system; match existing Vega site look/feel.
- Keep changes minimal, high impact, and mobile responsive.
- If existing components exist for Buttons, Alerts, Cards, etc., reuse them.
- Do not add new external dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

Pages to update
A) Homepage: https://vega.synozur.com
B) Login page: https://vega.synozur.com/login

========================================================
A) HOMEPAGE UPDATES (vega.synozur.com)
========================================================

1) Primary CTA labeling and placement (above the fold)
- Ensure the top hero section has a primary CTA button labeled exactly:
  "Get started now"
- Add a secondary CTA button next to it labeled exactly:
  "Log in"
- If there is currently only one CTA, keep it but relabel to "Get started now" and add "Log in" as secondary.

2) Add an explicit trust statement directly under the CTAs (above the fold)
Insert this copy under the CTA buttons, styled as small/secondary text but clearly readable:

"Start using Vega today — no purchase, no credit card, and no sales call required.
Create an account or sign in with Microsoft Entra SSO."

Formatting notes:
- Two lines on desktop, can stack on mobile.
- Emphasize "no purchase, no credit card" with either bold or higher contrast, but keep on-brand.

3) Add a simple “How access works” block below the hero (next section)
Create a compact 3-step horizontal (desktop) / vertical (mobile) block with heading:

Heading: "How access works"

Steps (exact text):
1) "Create a free account or use Microsoft Entra SSO"
2) "Start with your own workspace instantly"

Design:
- Use small icons if existing icon system is available; otherwise simple numbered circles.
- Keep it tight; max width aligned with other sections.

4) Add a small note near any pricing/enterprise language (if present)
If the homepage mentions enterprise, sales, pricing, or “contact us”, add a one-liner near that area:

"Vega is free to explore."

Only add this if there is an appropriate existing section; do not create a pricing section.

5) CTA routing
- "Get started now" should navigate to /login with a query param that indicates signup intent, e.g.:
  /login?mode=signup
- "Log in" navigates to /login (no params).

========================================================
B) LOGIN PAGE UPDATES (/login)
========================================================

1) Add a “New to Vega?” header above auth controls
Above the sign-in / SSO buttons, add:

Header: "New to Vega? You can start right away."
Subtext (exact):
"Create an account or use Microsoft Entra SSO — no credit card required."

2) Support both modes: signup vs login
- Read query param mode:
  - mode=signup should default the UI to “Create account” framing
  - otherwise default to “Log in” framing
- If the page already has both options, just ensure the copy and default state changes correctly.

3) Label the email flow explicitly
Wherever email/password is offered, ensure it is labeled for signup when in signup mode:
- Button text (signup mode): "Create free account"
- Button text (login mode): "Log in"

If there are separate tabs, label them:
- "Create account"
- "Log in"

4) Add Entra reassurance microcopy directly under the Entra button
Under the “Sign in with Microsoft” / “Entra” button, add small text:

"Uses your existing Microsoft identity. No tenant changes or device management required."

5) Keep “no credit card” visible near both auth methods
Ensure the phrase "no credit card required" appears near both:
- email signup
- Entra SSO
