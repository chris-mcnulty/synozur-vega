📊 Summary
Feature	Status	Priority
Check-In Editing	✅ COMPLETE	-
Company OS Export/Import	📋 Backlog	Medium
Snapshot System	📋 Backlog	Medium
Microsoft 365 Integration	🔌 Dependencies Ready	Low
AI Services	💡 Planned	Low
RBAC Enforcement	🔐 Critical Gap	High
Note: The RBAC enforcement is technically a security gap since the roles exist but aren't being enforced. This might be the highest priority item if you're moving toward production use.
