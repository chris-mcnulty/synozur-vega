Create a tabbed navigation overview component for the Vega website at vega.synozur.com, inspired by the interaction pattern used on the Microsoft Viva Learning page under “Discover, share, and prioritize learning.”

This component should present Vega’s key capabilities in a modern, scannable, enterprise-grade layout that matches the existing Vega visual style (typography, spacing, color system, tone).

The component will be managed from System Admin → Communication and must be configurable, toggleable, and editable without code changes.

Placement & Behavior

Insert this component as a new section that appears:

Only when enabled

Directly above the section that begins with:

“What You’ll Achieve
Three outcomes that matter”

When the feature is OFF, the page layout should collapse cleanly with no spacing artifacts.

Component Structure
Layout

Left-hand vertical tab navigation (desktop)

Horizontal tabs or accordion (mobile responsive)

Right-hand content panel that updates dynamically based on the selected tab

Each Tab Includes

Tab name (short, action-oriented)

Sidebar heading (editable)

Supporting paragraph text (editable, rich text allowed)

One primary screenshot or image

Optional secondary screenshot or diagram

Optional CTA link (internal or external)

Admin Configuration Requirements

Expose the following controls in System Admin → Communication → Vega Capabilities Section:

Global Controls

Feature ON / OFF toggle

Section headline (editable)

Section sub-headline (editable)

Per-Tab Controls (repeatable)

Tab label

Sidebar heading

Body copy (rich text)

Image upload (in-page upload, stored with media assets)

Optional secondary image

Optional CTA text + URL

Tab order (drag-and-drop preferred)

All text and images must be editable without code deployment.

Recommended Default Tabs & Screenshot Guidance

Populate with sensible defaults that admins can modify later:

Company Operating System

Screenshot: Vega dashboard showing strategy → execution alignment

Visual focus: operating rhythm, priorities, decision flow

Strategy to Execution

Screenshot: goal cascade, OKRs, or initiative tracking

Visual focus: clarity, progress, accountability

Leadership Alignment

Screenshot: executive view or board-level summary

Visual focus: shared context, decision readiness

AI-Powered Insights

Screenshot: Copilot-style insights, summaries, or recommendations

Visual focus: signal over noise, foresight

Governance & Visibility

Screenshot: permissions, auditability, system-level visibility

Visual focus: control, transparency, confidence

(Use placeholder images if real screenshots are not yet available.)

Design & UX Requirements

Match the existing Vega page style:

Typography scale

Color palette

Spacing rhythm

Button styles

Smooth tab transitions (no full page reload)

Accessible:

Keyboard navigable

ARIA roles for tabs

WCAG-compliant contrast

Performance-safe:

Lazy-load images

No blocking scripts

Technical Guidance

Implement as a reusable component

Content should be driven from a config object or CMS-style data structure

Avoid hard-coding text or image paths

Ensure future tabs can be added without layout refactoring

Deliverables

Front-end component (responsive, accessible)

Admin configuration schema

Default content populated

Clear inline comments explaining how to extend or customize

Outcome

The result should feel like a polished Microsoft-grade capability explainer, adapted to Vega’s positioning as a Company Operating System, while giving Synozur full editorial control over messaging, visuals, and rollout timing.
