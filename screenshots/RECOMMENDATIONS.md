## Implementation Notes

### Placement Strategy

- Each screenshot includes:
  - Descriptive filename in format: `##-feature-name.png`
  - Alt text for accessibility
  - Italic caption explaining what's shown

### File Organization
- All screenshots stored in `/screenshots/` directory
- Naming convention: `##-descriptive-name.png` (e.g., `01-login-page.png`)
- README.md in screenshots directory provides detailed capture guidelines

### Next Steps for Screenshot Creation
1. Set up demo environment with realistic sample data
2. Capture all 12 screenshots following the specifications in `/screenshots/README.md`
3. Optimize images for web (target ~500KB per file)
4. Verify all images display correctly in the user guide
5. Consider adding additional screenshots for:
   - Admin panel features (tenant management, user management)
   - Team management interface
   - Big Rocks (initiatives) management
   - Settings and preferences pages

## Benefits of These Screenshots

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major features have visual representation
2. **User-Centric**: Follows typical user workflows and journeys
3. **Balanced Distribution**: Even coverage across all modules
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Simple UI first, complex features later
5. **Accessibility**: Proper alt text and captions for all images
6. **Maintainability**: Clear naming and organization for easy updates

## Accessibility Considerations

All screenshot placeholders include:
- Descriptive filenames that indicate content
- Alt text in markdown format
- Supplementary italic captions describing key elements
- Sufficient context in surrounding text for users who cannot view images

## Quality Standards

Screenshots should meet these criteria:
- High resolution (minimum 1920x1080)
- Clear, readable text
- Professional sample data
- Consistent theme/styling (light mode recommended)
- Properly cropped to show relevant UI
- Optimized file size for web performance
