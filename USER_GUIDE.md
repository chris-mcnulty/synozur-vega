- **Objective Progress: 80%**

### OKR Cloning (Added Dec 20, 2025)

Clone objectives to simplify recurring OKR creation and cross-team alignment—either duplicating OKRs across teams or rolling over unfinished objectives to new time periods.

**Use Cases:**

**To Clone an Objective:**

1. Navigate to the Planning module
2. Hover over the objective you want to clone
3. Click the **"Clone"** option from the action menu
4. Configure clone options:
   - **Time Period**: Select target quarter/year (defaults to current period)
   - **Owner (applies to entire cloned hierarchy)**: Keep original owner for all cloned items OR assign a single new owner for all cloned items
   - **Scope**:
     - Clone only the objective (no children)
     - Clone objective and immediate children (Key Results only)
     - Clone objective and all children (full hierarchy including nested objectives)
5. Click **"Clone"**

**Important Notes:**
- Progress is reset to 0% for the cloned objective and its Key Results
- Historical check-ins are NOT copied (maintains clean history for the new time period)
- Relationships (linked strategies, annual goals, values) are preserved
- Big Rocks can be cloned along with the objective hierarchy

### Using the AI Assistant

**To Ask a Question:**

1. Open the AI chat panel (sparkle icon)

1. Increase brand awareness in target markets (75% progress)
2. Launch new website redesign (50% progress)
...

You: Which of these are at risk?

AI: Based on current status, "Launch new website redesign" is marked

## Launchpad (AI Kickstart Wizard)

**Added December 20, 2025**

The Launchpad is an AI-powered kickstart wizard that helps new organizations quickly establish their Company Operating System by analyzing existing strategic documents.

### What is Launchpad?

Launchpad allows you to upload organizational documents (strategic plans, annual reports, business plans) and uses AI to automatically generate a complete Company OS proposal including mission, vision, values, goals, strategies, objectives, and big rocks.

### Accessing Launchpad

Click **"Launchpad"** in the left sidebar.

### Using the Launchpad Wizard

#### Step 1: Upload Your Document

1. Click **"Start New Session"** or **"Upload Document"**
2. Select a file to upload:
   - **PDF**: Strategic plans, annual reports
   - **Word (.docx only)**: Business plans, planning documents
   - **Plain Text (.txt)**: Any text-based strategic content
3. Enter optional context:
   - Target year for the Company OS
   - Specific focus areas or priorities
   - Any additional instructions for the AI
4. Click **"Upload and Analyze"**

**What the AI Extracts:**
- Organization mission and vision
- Core values and culture
- Annual goals and targets
- Strategic initiatives
- Objectives and key results
- Major initiatives (Big Rocks)

#### Step 2: Review AI-Generated Proposal

The AI will analyze your document and generate structured proposals for each component:

1. **Foundation Elements**:
   - Mission statement
   - Vision statement
   - Company values (with descriptions)
   - Annual goals

2. **Strategic Components**:
   - Strategic initiatives with priorities
   - Linked to annual goals
   - Tagged with values

3. **Operational Elements**:
   - Objectives at various levels
   - Key Results with targets
   - Big Rocks (major initiatives)

#### Step 3: Review & Edit

Navigate through each section to review and refine the AI's suggestions:

1. **Foundation Review**:
   - Edit mission and vision statements
   - Modify value descriptions
   - Adjust annual goals
   - Add or remove values

2. **Strategy Review**:
   - Edit strategy titles and descriptions
   - Adjust priorities (High, Medium, Low)
   - Link to different annual goals
   - Add or remove strategies

3. **OKR Review**:
   - Edit objective titles and descriptions
   - Modify Key Result metrics and targets
   - Adjust ownership and time periods
   - Add, remove, or reorganize the OKR hierarchy

4. **Big Rocks Review**:
   - Edit initiative descriptions
   - Adjust due dates
   - Link to different Key Results
   - Modify priorities

#### Step 4: Approve and Deploy

Once you're satisfied with the proposal:

1. Review the summary of what will be created
2. Click **"Approve and Deploy"**
3. The system creates all entities in your tenant:
   - Foundation elements are set
   - Strategies are created
   - Objectives, Key Results, and Big Rocks are created
   - All relationships (links between strategies, goals, values) are established

**Draft Sessions:**
- Your work is automatically saved as a draft
- You can exit and return later to complete the wizard
- Drafts are saved until you either approve or delete them

### Consultant Mode

For Vega consultants working with clients:

1. Upload the client's strategic document
2. Use Launchpad to generate the initial Company OS proposal
3. Review and refine the suggestions based on your expertise
4. Share the draft with the client for their review and approval
5. The client can make final adjustments before deployment

### Best Practices for Launchpad

**Document Quality:**
- Use comprehensive strategic documents with clear goals and initiatives
- Include context about your organization, industry, and market
- More detailed documents yield better AI-generated proposals

**Review Thoroughly:**
- Don't blindly accept all AI suggestions
- The AI provides a starting point - your expertise refines it
- Ensure values and mission reflect your true culture

**Iterative Refinement:**
- Use the AI-generated structure as a foundation
- Add specific metrics and targets that the AI couldn't extract
- Reorganize the hierarchy to match your organizational structure

**When to Use Launchpad:**
- New organizations setting up their Company OS for the first time
- Organizations migrating from another system without structured data
- Annual planning sessions when starting fresh with a new strategic plan
- Creating templates for multiple similar organizations

- Check email verification status

**Add New User:**
1. Click **"Add User"**

#### 2. Manage Teams

Create and organize teams with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities:

**Accessing Team Management:**
1. Navigate to **Tenant Admin** section (Admin sidebar item)
2. Click on the **"Users & Teams"** tab

**View Teams:**
- See all teams in your organization
- View team member count
- See team description and details

**Add New Team:**
1. Click **"Add Team"** or **"Create Team"**
2. Enter:
   - **Team name**: Descriptive name for the team
   - **Description**: Purpose and focus of the team
   - **Team members**: Select users to add to the team
3. Click **"Save"** or **"Create"**

**Delete Team:**
1. Select a team from the list

4. **Note:**
   - Deleting a team does **not** delete associated OKRs. Objectives and key results remain in Vega but no longer have that team assigned.
   - Team-owned objectives become "unassigned" from a team: they continue to be visible to their objective owners and contributors and in any global views/filters that do not require a team.
   - **Best practice before deletion:** Review all active OKRs for the team and, where appropriate, reassign them to another team so you do not leave important OKRs without a team context.
   - **After deletion:** Use OKR filters (for example, filter by **No Team** or equivalent) to identify and clean up any remaining orphaned OKRs.
   - Vega may not automatically notify users when a team is deleted. Communicate team deletions and any OKR reassignments through your normal channels (e.g., email, meetings, announcements).

**Manage Team Members:**
- Add members: Select from list of users in your tenant
- Remove members: Click the remove icon next to member name
- View member roles: See what role each team member has
