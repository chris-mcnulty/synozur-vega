## Best Practices & Tips

### OKR Best Practices

#### Writing Good Objectives

**Do**:
- Make them aspirational and inspiring
- Use action verbs (build, grow, transform, achieve)
- Keep them qualitative
- Align with company strategies
- Set 3-5 objectives per time period

**Don't**:
- Make them too vague or generic
- Include metrics (those go in Key Results)
- Create more than 7 objectives per quarter
- Copy-paste from other organizations
- Set objectives without team input

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Build a world-class customer success organization"
- ✅ "Establish market leadership in our industry"
- ❌ "Increase revenue by 20%" (this is a Key Result)
- ❌ "Do better at sales" (too vague)

#### Writing Good Key Results

**Do**:
- Make them specific and measurable
- Use numbers (percentages, counts, currency)
- Set ambitious but achievable targets
- Include 2-5 KRs per objective
- Define clear measurement criteria

**Don't**:
- Use binary yes/no outcomes for everything
- Set unrealistic targets
- Create more than 5 KRs per objective
- Make KRs that are actually tasks
- Forget to define units

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Increase NPS score from 45 to 70"
- ✅ "Reduce customer churn from 8% to 3%"
- ✅ "Close 25 enterprise deals worth $2M+ total"
- ❌ "Improve customer satisfaction" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Hire 3 people and launch new feature" (these are tasks)
