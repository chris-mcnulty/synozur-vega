### Accessing the AI Assistant

Click the **sparkle icon (✨)** in the top right corner to open the AI chat panel.

### What the AI Can Do

The AI Assistant has access to your organization's data and can help with:

- "Show me all Key Results for the sales team"
- "List objectives owned by John Smith"

**4. Meeting Insights:**
- "Show upcoming quarterly meetings"
- "List all meetings linked to this objective"

**5. Context and Guidance:**
- "What is our company mission?"
- "What are our core values?"
- "Explain the OKR methodology"

### Using the AI Assistant

**To Ask a Question:**

1. Open the AI chat panel (sparkle icon)
2. Type your question in natural language
3. Press Enter or click Send
4. The AI will process your request and respond

1. Increase brand awareness in target markets (75% progress)
2. Launch new website redesign (50% progress)
...

You: Which of these are at risk?

AI: Based on current status, "Launch new website redesign" is marked

creation...
```

## Best Practices

### Setting Effective OKRs

**Objectives:**
- Make them aspirational and inspiring
- Use action-oriented language
- Keep them qualitative (not just numbers)
- Limit to 3-5 objectives per level per quarter
- Ensure alignment from organization → team → individual

**Key Results:**
- Must be measurable and quantifiable
- Should be ambitious but achievable
- Define clear start, target, and current values
- Limit to 3-5 key results per objective
- Use specific metrics (%, $, count, etc.)

**Big Rocks:**
- Define major initiatives, not tasks
- Link clearly to Key Results
- Set realistic due dates
- Assign clear ownership
- Update status regularly

### Regular Check-Ins

**Recommended Cadence:**
- **Key Results**: Weekly or bi-weekly
- **Objectives**: Monthly review
- **Strategies**: Quarterly review

**Check-In Best Practices:**
- Always add notes explaining progress
- Be honest about status (don't hide risks)
- Flag blockers early
- Celebrate wins when targets are exceeded

### Values-Driven Decisions

- Tag objectives with relevant company values
- Reference values in strategy descriptions

### Meeting Effectiveness

**Focus Rhythm Tips:**

### Using AI Effectively

**Maximize AI Value:**
- Ask questions before meetings to prep

- Query for insights, not just data retrieval
- Teach the AI your organization's language (grounding docs)

### Data Hygiene

**Keep Data Current:**
- Archive or close completed objectives
- Update Key Results regularly
- Mark Big Rocks complete when done
- Remove outdated strategies
- Verify team memberships each quarter

**Avoid Clutter:**
- Don't create too many nested objective levels
- Limit draft/inactive items
- Delete test data
- Use consistent naming conventions
